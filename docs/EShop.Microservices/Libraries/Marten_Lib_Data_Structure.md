# Underlying Data Structures of Catalog Microservices

## Overview

In the `Catalog` microservice, **Marten** is employed as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to interface with **PostgreSQL**. This setup leverages PostgreSQL's JSON capabilities, enabling a flexible, document-oriented approach within a relational database system. Marten transforms PostgreSQL into a .NET transactional document database, merging the advantages of document databases with the robustness of relational systems.

## Key Components

### 1. Marten as an ORM for PostgreSQL
   - **Marten** acts as an Object-Relational Mapper that simplifies interaction with PostgreSQL.
   - It utilizes PostgreSQL's **JSON column features** to store and manage data in a document-based format within a relational framework.
   - **Flexibility of JSON**: Marten uses PostgreSQL's JSON columns to allow dynamic data structures, making it easier to handle complex data without needing a rigid schema.

### 2. PostgreSQL JSON Column Features
   - PostgreSQL supports **JSON and JSONB** column types, allowing efficient storage and querying of JSON documents.
   - JSON columns enable the **Catalog microservice** to store data in a flexible document format, which can be queried as JSON while still benefiting from PostgreSQL's ACID compliance.
   - This approach is particularly useful for storing semi-structured data that may evolve over time.

### 3. Marten as a .NET Transactional Document Database
   - Marten transforms PostgreSQL into a **.NET transactional document database**, providing advanced features like:
     - **Optimistic concurrency control** for managing concurrent data access.
     - **Event sourcing capabilities** to manage data changes over time, useful for tracking product lifecycle or inventory changes in the catalog.
     - **Soft deletes and versioning**, enabling advanced data management use cases.
   - This setup allows the Catalog microservice to treat PostgreSQL as a document store, ideal for a microservices architecture where flexibility and rapid iteration are essential.

### 4. Document and Relational Hybrid Approach
   - By combining the **flexibility of a document database** with the **reliability of a relational database**, this architecture supports a wide range of use cases.
   - **Marten** provides a document-based interface to PostgreSQL, enabling schema-less data handling without sacrificing the transactional integrity of a relational database.
   - This approach is scalable and suitable for catalog data, where the schema may vary over time, and data integrity is crucial.

## Advantages of Using Marten with PostgreSQL

- **Flexible Data Modeling**:
  - Supports both structured and semi-structured data, enabling efficient handling of evolving data structures.
- **Scalable and Reliable**:
  - Offers PostgreSQL's ACID properties with the added flexibility of JSON storage, making it suitable for cloud-native and microservice-based architectures.
- **Enhanced Query Capabilities**:
  - Marten provides LINQ-based querying, enabling seamless data retrieval using .NET standard query syntax.
- **Transactional Support**:
  - Full support for .NET transactions ensures that operations remain consistent and reliable, even within complex data workflows.

## Summary

The Catalog microservice uses Marten to extend PostgreSQL into a document-oriented database with transactional support, ideal for flexible and scalable data management. This setup combines the best of both document and relational worlds, making it a powerful choice for microservices that handle dynamic and evolving data, such as product catalogs.

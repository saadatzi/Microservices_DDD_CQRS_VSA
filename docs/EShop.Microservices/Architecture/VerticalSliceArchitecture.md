# Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) for Catalog Microservices

## Overview
The **Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)** is a design approach that organizes code by feature rather than by technical layers. In this architecture, each feature is encapsulated in a **single `.cs` file** containing everything needed to execute that feature, from UI interactions to database infrastructure.

## Benefits of Vertical Slice Architecture
- **Feature-focused Organization**: Code is organized by features, making it easier to locate and manage specific functionalities.
- **Modularity**: Each feature is self-contained, which reduces dependencies between features and improves maintainability.
- **Scalability**: Adding new features requires minimal changes to existing code, supporting scalability.
- **Improved Focus on Business Logic**: Allows developers to focus on delivering business value by aligning code structure with business requirements.

## Layers in a Vertical Slice

Each feature in the Catalog Microservice is structured into the following layers:

1. **UI Layer**: 
   - Handles user interactions and interfaces, typically through API endpoints in a microservice.
   - Defines how data is presented or retrieved for a given feature.

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Manages the business logic for the feature.
   - Coordinates between the UI and Domain layers to process requests, validate data, and manage transactions.

3. **Domain Layer**:
   - Defines core entities, data models, and rules for the feature.
   - Contains the logic and constraints that form the "business domain" of the application.

4. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Provides access to external resources such as databases, file storage, or external services.
   - Handles database interactions, including data persistence and retrieval.

### New Feature Encapsulation
When a new feature is added:
- A new **Vertical Slice** is created, which includes its own instances of each layer (UI, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) needed to operate independently.
- This encapsulated approach ensures that features can be added, modified, or removed with minimal impact on the rest of the system.

## Why Use Vertical Slice Architecture?

Vertical Slice Architecture provides a more cohesive and modular approach for organizing microservices, particularly in complex systems where multiple features need to coexist without creating interdependencies.

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: VSA separates each feature from others, reducing coupling and potential conflicts.
- **Enhanced Code Readability**: Each featureâ€™s code is located in one file or folder, making it easier to understand, navigate, and manage.
- **Easier Testing and Debugging**: Each vertical slice can be tested independently, improving test coverage and simplifying debugging.

# Patterns & Principles of Ordering Microservices

## Presentation API Layer Patterns

- **Minimal APIs**: Leverages the latest lightweight approach for building HTTP APIs with ASP.NET, focusing on minimal setup and reducing boilerplate code.
- **REPR Design Pattern**: Follows the Request-Endpoint-Response pattern to simplify and structure API endpoints.
- **ASP.NET Dependency Injection (DI) & Routing**: Utilizes the latest ASP.NET 8 features to manage dependency injection and routing more efficiently.

## Section Flow

The flow within the Ordering Microservices is structured as follows:

- **Domain** → **Infrastructure** → **Application** → **Presentation**

This layered approach helps maintain a clean architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and promoting modular development.

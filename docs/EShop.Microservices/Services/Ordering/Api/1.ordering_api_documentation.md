# Ordering.API Layer Exposing Minimal API Endpoints with Carter

## Overview
The **Ordering.API Layer** is developed using Carter, which enables minimal REST API endpoint exposure while following **Clean Architecture** principles.

### Key Features
- **Developing Minimal REST APIs**: Carter allows the development of lightweight RESTful endpoints without the need for traditional controllers, promoting simplicity and cleaner architecture.
- **REPR Design Pattern**: Implements the **Request, Endpoint, Response (REPR)** pattern to standardize the lifecycle of API calls within the **CQRS and MediatR** setup.
- **Order CRUD Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting orders in the **Ordering.API Layer**.
- **Get Order Endpoints**: Offers endpoints specifically for retrieving orders.
- **Custom Exception Handling**: Implements cross-cutting concerns by integrating custom exception handling within the **Ordering Microservice**.
- **Health Checks**: Uses **EF.Core** and **SQL Server** to perform health checks, ensuring the microservice's availability and integrity.
- **Testing Endpoints**: Includes a testing strategy for **CQRS**-based endpoints, ensuring compliance with **Clean Architecture** principles.

### Main Target of API Layer
The main goal of this API layer is to:
- Expose minimal REST APIs, serving as the entry point for external requests to interact with the **Ordering** microservice.

# REPR Design Pattern

## Overview
The **REPR Design Pattern** simplifies the development of REST API endpoints by implementing a **Request, Endpoint, and Response** flow.

### Components
- **Request**: Represents the data structure expected by the endpoint.
- **Endpoint**: The logic that the endpoint executes based on the request data.
- **Response**: The data structure that the endpoint returns after processing.

### Benefits
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: This pattern promotes simplicity by enforcing the **Single Responsibility Principle** for endpoints.
- **Ease of Understanding**: Developers only need to focus on **Request** and **Response**, simplifying development and maintenance of endpoints.

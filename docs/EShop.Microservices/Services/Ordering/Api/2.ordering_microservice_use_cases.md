# Application Use Cases of Ordering Microservices

## CRUD Ordering Operations
The **Ordering Microservice** supports various **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for handling orders, which are as follows:

- **Get Order with Items**: Allows retrieval of orders with their items. This can be filtered by **Name** and **Customer**.
- **Create a New Order**: Provides functionality to create a new order in the system.
- **Update an Existing Order**: Enables updates to an existing order.
- **Delete Order**: Allows the deletion of an order from the system.
- **Add and Remove Item from Order**: Supports adding and removing individual items within an order.

## Asynchronous Ordering Operations
The **Ordering Microservice** also supports asynchronous operations for handling events and actions that don't require immediate response, thus enhancing scalability and performance.

- **Basket Checkout**: Consumes the Basket Checkout event from **RabbitMQ** using **MassTransit** for asynchronous processing.
- **Order Fulfilment**: Performs various tasks involved in fulfilling an order, such as:
  - Billing
  - Shipment
  - Notifications

- **Raise OrderCreated Domain Event**: Triggers an **OrderCreated** domain event, which leads to an **integration event**. This enables communication between different bounded contexts or microservices.

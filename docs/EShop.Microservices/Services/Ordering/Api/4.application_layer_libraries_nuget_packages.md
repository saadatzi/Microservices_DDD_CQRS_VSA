# Libraries and NuGet Packages of Application Layer

## Presentation API Layer Libraries

- **ASP.NET Core Libraries**: Utilized for core functionalities and infrastructure support.
- **Carter**: A lightweight library for defining Minimal API endpoints, used to structure API endpoints efficiently.
- **Building Blocks**: Shared libraries that come from the Application Layer, providing common utilities and references. This includes:
  - **MediatR**: For implementing the mediator pattern, helping to decouple request/response handling.
  - **Mapster**: For object mapping, simplifying the transformation between different object types.
  - **Other Common Libraries**: Any additional libraries that serve as utilities across the microservices.

## Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The structure of the microservices architecture is based on Clean Architecture principles, enhanced with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) practices. The architecture is divided into:

- **Core Layers**:
  - **Domain**: Contains the core business logic and entities.
  - **Application**: Manages application-specific logic and orchestrates the Domain and Infrastructure layers.

- **Periphery Layers**:
  - **Infrastructure**: Handles external dependencies and database interactions.
  - **Presentation**: Exposes endpoints, such as APIs, to the outside world.

This structure promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability, making the system easy to maintain and extend.

# Libraries NuGet Packages of Application Layer

## Application UC Layer Libraries

- **Libraries from BuildingBlocks (e.g., MediatR, FluentValidation):**
  - `MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`
  - `FluentValidation`
  - `FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions`
  - `Mapster` for object mapping
  - `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions`

## Clean Architecture with DDD

- **Core Layers**:
  - **Domain**: Contains core business logic and domain entities.
  - **Application**: Implements use cases, services, and application logic.
- **Periphery Layers**:
  - **Presentation**: User interface components and API controllers.
  - **Infrastructure**: External dependencies, such as database and file storage, and implementations of interfaces defined in the core layers.
- **BuildingBlocks**: Shared components and libraries for cross-cutting concerns, reusable throughout the application.

**Diagram Overview**:
The image illustrates a clean architecture approach with Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It highlights the separation of concerns by placing the core business logic in the central layers, while peripheral layers depend on these core layers for stability and reusability.

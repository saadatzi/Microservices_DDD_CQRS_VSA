# Pagination with EF Core

EF Core provides support for pagination through LINQ methods `Skip` and `Take`. These methods allow us to retrieve only a subset of data corresponding to a specific page, improving performance and user experience by loading data in manageable chunks.

## Key Concepts

- **EF Core Pagination**:
  - EF Core enables pagination using the `Skip` and `Take` methods.
  - These methods are part of LINQ, a querying language used in .NET for data manipulation.

- **Why Use Pagination?**
  - Pagination allows us to retrieve only a portion of the dataset at a time.
  - By loading data page-by-page, we reduce memory consumption and improve the efficiency of data retrieval, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Methods

- **Skip Method**:
  - The `Skip` method skips the first `n` elements in a sequence.
  - Commonly used to move past already retrieved records and start from a specific position.

- **Take Method**:
  - The `Take` method retrieves a specified number of contiguous elements from the start of a sequence.
  - Useful to define the size of each "page" of data that we want to retrieve.

## Implementing Pagination with EF Core

By combining `Skip` and `Take`, we can implement pagination logic in EF Core, enabling us to divide data into pages and retrieve specific pages as needed.

## Example

Here is a basic example of implementing pagination in EF Core:

```csharp
int pageNumber = 2;
int pageSize = 10;

var paginatedData = await dbContext.Items
    .Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize)
    .Take(pageSize)
    .ToListAsync();
```

In this example:

- `pageNumber` specifies the current page to retrieve.
- `pageSize` defines the number of items per page.
- `Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize)` calculates the number of items to skip, based on the page size and the page number.
- `Take(pageSize)` retrieves the number of items for the current page.

## Benefits of Pagination

- **Improves Performance**: Only a small portion of the data is loaded at a time, reducing load on the database and improving application performance.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Loading data in smaller chunks improves the responsiveness of the application, especially for interfaces displaying large datasets.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage on both the server and client sides by avoiding loading the entire dataset at once.

## Summary

- **Pagination** in EF Core is achieved through the **Skip** and **Take** methods.
- These methods are essential for efficiently retrieving and displaying large datasets.
- Pagination helps in dividing data into "pages" and loading specific pages only, enhancing performance and user experience.

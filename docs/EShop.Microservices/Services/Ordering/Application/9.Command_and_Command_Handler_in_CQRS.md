# Command and Command Handler in CQRS Ordering.Application Layer

## Commands
- **Purpose**: Commands are responsible for changing the state of the system.
- **Functionality**: They encapsulate the data required for a specific action.

## Command Handlers
- **Corresponding Handler**: Each command has a designated handler.
- **Role of the Handler**: The handler interacts with the domain model and is responsible for persisting changes.
- **Execution**: It executes business logic and updates the system state through repositories.

### Workflow
1. **Client Request**: A client sends a request to the system.
2. **MediatR Lifecycle**: The request goes through the MediatR lifecycle.
3. **Command Handler**: The command handler processes the command and interacts with the domain model.
4. **Repository**: The handler uses a repository to persist changes in the database.
5. **Response**: After processing, the system sends a response back to the client.

### Diagram
The diagram illustrates the **Microservices CQRS and MediatR Request Lifecycle**:
- The client sends a request, which is handled by the command handler.
- The command handler accesses the **Repository** and communicates with the **DB** to apply changes.
- A **Response** is generated and returned to the client, completing the cycle.

# CQRS, Event Sourcing Pattern, and Eventual Consistency

## CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation

- **CQRS design pattern** is used to avoid complex queries and eliminate inefficient joins.
- Separates **read and write operations** by using separate databases.
- **Commands:** Changing the state of data within the application.
- **Queries:** Handling complex join operations, returning results without altering data state.
- **Microservices architectures** benefit from CQRS by managing high-volume data requirements.
- Using a **single database for services** can cause bottlenecks.
- **CQRS and Event Sourcing** patterns improve application performance.
- CQRS offers a way to **separate read and write data** to maximize query performance and scalability.

### CQRS â€“ Read and Write Operations

- A **monolithic application** using a single database for both queries and CRUD operations faces challenges with complex queries and operations.
- As applications grow more complex, **query and CRUD operations** can become unmanageable.
- Complex queries and CRUD operations can **lock the database** due to high computation latency.
- Performing CRUD operations requires complex validations, which can slow down database operations.
- **Separation of concerns** principle: separate reading and writing databases.
  - **Read database:** Uses NoSQL databases with denormalized data.
  - **Write database:** Uses relational databases with normalized data supporting strong consistency.

## Event Sourcing Pattern

- **Event Sourcing** captures every change to the data as an event, instead of overriding data.
- **Event Store** acts as the source-of-truth for the application state.
- A sequential **event list** allows the generation of materialized views representing the final data state.
- **Publish/subscribe patterns** with message brokers handle event publication.
- Event lists enable **replaying events** at a specific timestamp to rebuild the latest data state.

### Event Sourcing Pattern - 2

- **Event Sourcing** saves a new record for each data change, creating a sequential list of past events.
- The **Event Store database** is the single source-of-truth.
- Sequential event lists allow the generation of materialized views to perform queries.
- The Event Store can be converted into a read database using the Materialized Views Pattern.
- Publish/subscribe patterns manage event conversion, enabling materialized views.

## CQRS with Event Sourcing Pattern

- **CQRS pattern** is often paired with the Event Sourcing pattern.
- Events are stored in the **write database** as the source-of-truth.
- The **read database** in CQRS provides materialized views of data with denormalized tables.
- Materialized views read data, convert events from the write database, and present them as denormalized views.
- The **write database** never stores data states, only events.
- Event history allows data to be replayed to regenerate the state.
- The system benefits from **increased query performance** and scalable databases.

## Eventual Consistency Principle

- **Eventual Consistency** results from CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns.
- Particularly useful for systems prioritizing **high availability** over strict consistency.
- The system will eventually become consistent after a certain period.
- **Latency** is inherent in Eventual Consistency, providing consistency after a set period.
- **Consistency Levels:**
  - **Strict Consistency:** Data is immediately visible to all clients after saving.
  - **Eventual Consistency:** Data takes time to be visible to clients reading it.

### Eventual Consistency Principle - 2

1. Actions in the application save events into the **event store**.
2. Data converts to a reading database using a publish/subscribe pattern with message brokers.
3. Data is denormalized in a materialized view database for querying.

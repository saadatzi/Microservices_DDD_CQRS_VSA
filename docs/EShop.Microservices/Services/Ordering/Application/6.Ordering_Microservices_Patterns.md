# Patterns & Principles of Ordering Microservices

## Infrastructure Data Layer Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.
- **EF Core ORM**:
  - **Code-First Approach**: Allows developers to define the database structure using code, and migrations to update it over time.
  - **Migrations**: EF Core supports migrations to incrementally apply schema changes to the database.
  - **Seeding Database**: Populate the database with initial or test data.
- **Value Object Complex Types**: Define complex types as immutable objects without identity, commonly used to represent values.
- **EF Aggregate Root Entities**: Implement DDD principles, where entities are grouped under a root entity that acts as the entry point for manipulating a set of related entities.
- **Entity Configurations with ModelBuilder**: Provides configuration for entities within EF Core.
  - **DDD to EF Core Entity Object Mapping**: Apply Domain-Driven Design principles to map domain objects to EF Core entities.
- **Raise & Dispatch Domain Events**: Implement event-driven architecture by raising and dispatching domain events using EF Core and MediatR.

## Application UC Layer Patterns
- **CQRS and CQS Pattern**:
  - **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates read and write operations, improving scalability and performance.
  - **CQS (Command Query Separation)**: Ensures commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) are separated to adhere to the single responsibility principle.
- **Command and Command Handler Patterns**: Defines commands to represent operations and handlers to process them, commonly used in CQRS.
- **Mediator Pattern**:
  - **MediatR Pipeline Behaviors**: Handles cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, and caching by placing them in the pipeline.
- **Fluent Validation**: Implements fluent validation for complex validation logic.
- **Logging Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Centralize logging functionality for application monitoring and troubleshooting.

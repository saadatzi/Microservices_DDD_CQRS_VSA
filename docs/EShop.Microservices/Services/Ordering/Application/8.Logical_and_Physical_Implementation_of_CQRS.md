# Logical and Physical Implementation of CQRS

## Logical Implementation of CQRS

- **Splitting Operations, Not Databases**: The logical implementation of CQRS involves separating the read (query) operations from the write (command) operations at the code level without necessarily using separate databases.
- **Single Database, Distinct Paths**: Although the same database is used, the paths for reading and writing data remain distinct, which helps in managing different use cases for data.

## Physical Implementation of CQRS

- **Separate Databases**: In the physical implementation, the read and write operations are split not just at the code level but also physically by using separate databases.
- **Challenges**: This approach can introduce data consistency and synchronization issues, which need to be managed carefully to maintain the accuracy and availability of data.

### Diagram
The accompanying diagram illustrates the CQRS design pattern, where:
- **Command** operations write to a **Write Database**.
- **Query** operations read from a **Read Database**.
- The pattern may involve **Eventual Consistency** to synchronize between the databases.

Hereâ€™s the updated markdown document, including the additional information on anemic and rich domain models along with a description of the chart. I've also created a prompt to sketch the figure in a blueprint design.

# Domain Model Entity Types: Anemic vs. Rich Domain Models

## Anemic Domain Model
- **Anemic Domain Model** refers to a pattern where business logic is scattered across the application, often in services.
- Entities in this model are **simple data containers** without embedded business logic.
- This approach can lead to issues with **maintainability** and **understanding the business logic**, as logic is not encapsulated within entities.

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public List<OrderItem> OrderItems { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}
```

### Characteristics of Anemic Model
- Business logic is placed outside entities.
- Entities lack behavior and act as data holders.
- Results in an increase in **complexity** and **maintenance effort** over time.

## Rich Domain Model
- **Rich Domain Model** entities encapsulate both **data and behavior**, containing methods that enforce **business rules** and **domain logic** within the entities.
- This model more closely aligns with the **real-world business domain** by embedding relevant logic within each entity.

```csharp
public class Order : Aggregate<Guid>
{
    private readonly List<OrderItem> _orderItems = new();
    public IReadOnlyList<OrderItem> OrderItems => _orderItems.AsReadOnly();

    public void AddOrderItem(OrderItem item)
    {
        // Domain logic to add an item
    }

    public void RemoveOrderItem(OrderItemId itemId)
    {
        // Domain logic to remove an item
    }
    // Other properties...
}
```

### Characteristics of Rich Model
- Business logic is **encapsulated within entities**.
- Closely represents the **business domain**.
- Can be **more complex to design initially** but results in a **more maintainable** and **cohesive model** over time.

## Comparison of Anemic and Rich Domain Models

The following chart illustrates the relationship between **time and complexity** (or "sadness") as it pertains to each model.

- **Anemic Model**: Shows a steep increase in complexity over time as business logic becomes harder to manage.
- **Rich Model**: Demonstrates a more gradual increase in complexity, making it easier to maintain and understand as the system grows.

# Microservices Synchronous Communication
=============================================

## Overview
------------

Synchronous communication in a microservices architecture utilizes protocols like HTTP or gRPC to handle requests and return synchronous responses. This approach is commonly employed when immediate responses are necessary between services or when a client expects instant feedback from a service.

## Key Concepts of Synchronous Communication
---------------------------------------------

* **Real-time Responses**: Leveraging HTTP or gRPC protocols for immediate feedback.
* **Request-Response Cycle**: The client sends a request and waits for a response from the service before proceeding.
* **Thread Blocking**: Client code blocks its thread until the response is received from the server.
* **Protocols Used**: Typically includes HTTP and HTTPS for request-response interactions.

## Workflow Blueprint for Synchronous Communication
---------------------------------------------------

### Workflow Steps:

1. **Client → Basket Service**: Client sends a request to Basket service and awaits response.
2. **Basket Service → Product Service**: Basket service synchronously requests data from Product service.
3. **Product Service → Pricing Service**: Product service makes a synchronous call to Pricing service for pricing details.
4. **Pricing Service → Order Service**: Pricing service may request details from Order service, continuing the synchronous chain.
5. **Response Back to Client**: Each service responds in turn, passing information back up the chain to the client.

### Diagram Representation:

Client → Basket Service → Product Service → Pricing Service → Order Service
                 ↑                   ↑                  ↑                    ↑
                 └────────────Response Chain──────────────┘

*Each arrow represents a synchronous call, where the calling service waits for the response from the next service in line before proceeding.*

## Characteristics of Synchronous Communication
------------------------------------------------

* **Blocking Nature**: Each request is blocking, requiring a thread or client to wait for a response before continuing.
* **Real-Time Response Requirement**: Ideal for scenarios necessitating immediate feedback.
* **Thread Blocking**: Client operations are paused while awaiting a response, potentially impacting scalability and resource utilization.

## Use Cases for Synchronous Communication
---------------------------------------------

* **User Requests**: Applications requiring immediate client feedback, such as:
        + Checking product availability
        + Real-time price updates
* **Data Consistency**: Scenarios where services depend on accurate, up-to-date information fetched in real-time from other services.
* **Microservices Integration**: Suitable for sequential interactions between microservices.

## Considerations
-------------------

While synchronous communication offers simplicity and real-time feedback, its blocking nature can introduce bottlenecks in high-load systems. For scalable systems, **asynchronous communication** might be preferable, allowing for non-blocking data transfer.

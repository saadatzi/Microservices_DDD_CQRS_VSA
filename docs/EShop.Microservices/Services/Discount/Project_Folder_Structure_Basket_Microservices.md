## Project Folder Structure of Basket Microservices

### Folder Structure Overview

1. **Models**
   - SQLite entity that defines the data model for the application.
   - Example: `Coupon.cs` represents the structure of the `Coupon` entity.

2. **Data**
   - Contains Entity Framework (EF) Core data context and migration files.
   - Includes helper and extension classes for database operations.
   - Key files:
     - `DiscountContext.cs`: The EF Core database context, handling data operations.
     - `Extensions.cs`: Contains additional methods to facilitate data handling and configuration.

3. **Service**
   - Contains gRPC service classes that implement the core logic of gRPC-based services.
   - Example: `DiscountService.cs` which defines the gRPC service methods related to discount functionalities.

4. **Protos**
   - Holds protocol buffer (.proto) files that define the gRPC endpoints and messages.
   - Example: `discount.proto` defines the gRPC service contracts and data messages for the Discount API.

### Mapping to N-Layer Architecture

The project structure maps to a traditional N-layer architecture as follows:

- **Models** → **Domain Layer**
- **Data** → **Data Access Layer**
- **Services** → **Business Layer**
- **Protos** → **Presentation Layer**

This mapping provides a clear separation of concerns, aligning each folder with a specific layer in the architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability.

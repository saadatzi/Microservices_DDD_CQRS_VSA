# Basket.API Microservices Repository Class Diagram

## Overview
This document provides a detailed overview of the repository pattern implemented in the Basket.API microservices. The repository pattern serves to separate the data access logic from the business logic, promoting a clean architecture and enhancing maintainability.

# Key Components

## 1. IBasketRepository
- **Type**: Interface
- **Description**:
  - Defines the contract for the repository methods that interact with the data store.
  - Provides a consistent way to manage basket-related data operations, allowing for easier testing and maintenance.

## 2. BasketRepository
- **Type**: Class
- **Description**:
  - Implements the `IBasketRepository` interface and serves as the primary data access layer for handling basket operations.
  - Responsible for directly interacting with the database, performing operations like adding, updating, and deleting basket items.

## 3. CachedBasketRepository
- **Type**: Class
- **Description**:
  - A specialized implementation of the `IBasketRepository` designed to enhance performance through caching.
  - Uses caching strategies to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need for repeated database queries and improving response times.

# Design Patterns Utilized

## 1. Repository Pattern
- **Purpose**:
  - Abstracts the data access layer and encapsulates the logic required to access data sources.
  - This separation allows for easier management of data operations and makes the application more modular.

## 2. Decorator Pattern
- **Purpose**:
  - Enables adding new functionality to an existing class without altering its structure.
  - Useful for extending the behavior of the `BasketRepository` by adding caching or logging without modifying its core functionality.

## 3. Cache-aside Pattern
- **Purpose**:
  - Optimizes data access by checking the cache before querying the database.
  - If the data is not found in the cache, it retrieves it from the database and stores it in the cache for future requests.

# Conclusion
The Basket.API microservices utilize a structured approach to data management through the repository pattern. By defining clear interfaces and implementing them in distinct classes, the architecture remains clean and maintainable. The integration of design patterns such as the Decorator and Cache-aside patterns further enhances performance and flexibility, making the system robust for handling various data operations.

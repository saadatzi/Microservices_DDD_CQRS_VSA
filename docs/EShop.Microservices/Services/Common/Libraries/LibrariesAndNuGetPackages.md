# Libraries and NuGet Packages of Catalog Microservices

## Overview
The Catalog Microservice uses a variety of libraries and NuGet packages to streamline development and enhance functionality. Below are the core libraries and their roles within the microservice.

### 1. MediatR for CQRS
- **Purpose**: The **MediatR** library simplifies the implementation of the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern by providing an in-process messaging system.
- **Functionality**: MediatR facilitates the dispatching of commands and queries through a mediator, which helps to decouple request handling from business logic.

### 2. Carter for API Endpoints
- **Purpose**: **Carter** is a lightweight library for defining API endpoints in a clean and concise manner.
- **Functionality**: It enables easier routing and handling of HTTP requests, making the API code more readable and maintainable.

### 3. Marten for PostgreSQL Interaction
- **Purpose**: **Marten** transforms PostgreSQL into a transactional document database, allowing the microservice to leverage PostgreSQL’s JSON capabilities.
- **Functionality**: It provides robust support for storing, querying, and managing JSON data, making it suitable for document-oriented data storage and handling complex data structures.

### 4. Mapster for Object Mapping
- **Purpose**: **Mapster** is a fast, configurable object mapper that simplifies the task of mapping objects between different layers.
- **Functionality**: Mapster streamlines the transformation of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to and from domain models, reducing boilerplate code and improving code clarity.

### 5. FluentValidation for Input Validation
- **Purpose**: **FluentValidation** provides a fluent API for building strongly-typed validation rules, ensuring that inputs meet certain criteria before being processed.
- **Functionality**: It helps to validate incoming data, catch errors early, and integrate validation logic seamlessly within the microservice’s pipeline.

## Summary of Libraries
Each of these libraries contributes to different aspects of the Catalog Microservice:

- **MediatR**: Supports CQRS by handling commands and queries through a mediator.
- **Carter**: Simplifies API endpoint definitions and routing.
- **Marten**: Enables PostgreSQL to function as a JSON document database.
- **Mapster**: Facilitates efficient and configurable object mapping.
- **FluentValidation**: Ensures input data is validated and conforms to expected rules.

These libraries collectively enhance the functionality, maintainability, and scalability of the Catalog Microservice.

# Patterns & Principles of Catalog Microservices

## Overview
The Catalog Microservices architecture utilizes a combination of patterns and principles to create a scalable, maintainable, and efficient system. Below are some key patterns and principles implemented within the Catalog Microservice.

### 1. CQRS Pattern
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** divides the systemâ€™s operations into two distinct types: commands (write operations) and queries (read operations).
- **Benefits**: This separation allows for more scalable data handling and improved performance for read-heavy applications. It also enables the use of separate databases for reads and writes, facilitating eventual consistency.

### 2. Mediator Pattern
- **Mediator Pattern** facilitates communication between objects through a central "mediator" object, reducing direct dependencies and coupling between components.
- In the Catalog Microservice, **MediatR** library is used to implement the mediator pattern, simplifying the flow of data between components and reducing interdependencies.

### 3. Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a core feature in ASP.NET Core, enabling the injection of required dependencies into classes rather than having classes construct their dependencies.
- **Benefits**: DI improves modularity, testability, and maintainability, making it easier to manage dependencies across the microservice.

### 4. Minimal APIs and Routing in ASP.NET 8
- **Minimal APIs** in ASP.NET 8 allow for lightweight and simplified endpoint definitions, reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed for API creation.
- **Routing**: Minimal APIs make it easier to define routes and handle HTTP requests with concise syntax, making the Catalog Microservice more efficient and easier to develop.

### 5. ORM Pattern (Object-Relational Mapping)
- The **ORM Pattern** abstracts database interactions, allowing developers to work with database objects using high-level code instead of raw SQL.
- In the Catalog Microservice, an ORM library is used to facilitate the mapping between database tables and .NET objects, enabling a more intuitive and structured approach to data management.

## Summary of Key Principles
1. **Scalability**: Patterns like CQRS and DI support scalability by separating responsibilities and managing dependencies efficiently.
2. **Maintainability**: The use of the Mediator Pattern and Minimal APIs improves maintainability by reducing coupling and simplifying API definitions.
3. **Performance**: By implementing CQRS and using optimized ORMs, the microservice can handle high-demand queries and updates more effectively.
4. **Modularity**: Dependency Injection and the Mediator Pattern enable modular design, allowing individual components to be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

This document summarizes the core patterns and principles in use for the Catalog Microservice, helping to create a structured, efficient, and scalable solution.
